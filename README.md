Unfortunately I have had to take a break from Mobile development for a while to focus on building other skills so this app will remain unfinished for some time. As a result the app only runs based on local data as I have not finished the google API call or the map/setting functions. Also I have only completed testing for IOS so performance on Android may be affected. Restaurant information and a menu template can still be viewed, and a search can be performed for the following locations:
Antwerp
Chicago
San Francisco
Toronto

To run the program:
Download the expo cli here https://expo.io/tools#cli
Clone the app.
Run <yarn> in the terminal to install dependencies.
Run <expo start> in the terminal to pull up a QR code that can be used to run the app on any IOS device using the expo app.
